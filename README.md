SnappySnippet
======================

Chrome/Chromium extension that allows easy CSS+HTML extraction of specific DOM element. Created snippet can be then exported to CodePen, jsFiddle or JS Bin with one click.

Other features:
- cleans up HTML (removing unnecessary attributes, fixing indentation)
- optimizes CSS to make it readable
- fully configurable (all filters can be turned off)
- nice UI thanks to Bootstrap & Flat-UI projects
- works with :before and :after pseudo elements
